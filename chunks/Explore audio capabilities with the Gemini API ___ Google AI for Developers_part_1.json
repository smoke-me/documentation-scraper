  "text": "# Explore audio capabilities with the Gemini API ___ Google AI for Developers Gemini can respond to prompts about audio. For example, Gemini can: Describe, summarize, or answer questions about audio content. Provide answers or a transcription about a specific segment of the audio. This guide demonstrates different ways to interact with audio files and audio content using the Gemini API. Gemini supports the following audio format MIME types: Gemini represents each second of audio as 32 tokens; for example, one minute of audio is represented as 1,920 tokens. Gemini can only infer responses to English-language speech. Gemini can \"understand\" non-speech components, such as birdsong or sirens. The maximum supported length of audio data in a single prompt is 9.5 hours. Gemini doesn't limit the number of audio files in a single prompt; however, the total combined length of all audio files in a single prompt cannot exceed 9.5 hours. Gemini downsamples audio files to a 16 Kbps data resolution. If the audio source contains multiple channels, Gemini combines those channels down to a single channel. This guide shows how to upload audio files using the File API and then generate text outputs from audio inputs. To learn more, see the following resources: File prompting strategies: The Gemini API supports prompting with text, image, audio, and video data, also known as multimodal prompting. System instructions: System instructions let you steer the behavior of the model based on your specific needs and use cases. Safety guidance: Sometimes generative AI models produce unexpected outputs, such as outputs that are inaccurate, biased, or offensive. Post-processing and human evaluation are essential to limit the risk of harm from such outputs.
