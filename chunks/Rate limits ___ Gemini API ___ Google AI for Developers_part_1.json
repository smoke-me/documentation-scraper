  "text": "# Rate limits ___ Gemini API ___ Google AI for Developers Rate limits regulate the number of requests you can make to the Gemini API within a given timeframe. These limits help ensure fair usage, protect against abuse, and help maintain system performance for all users. Your usage is evaluated against each limit, and exceeding any of them will trigger a rate limit error. For example, if your RPM limit is 20, making 21 requests within a minute will result in an error, even if you haven't exceeded your TPM or other limits. Rate limits are applied per project, not per API key. Limits vary depending on the specific model being used, and some limits only apply to specific models. For example, Images per minute, or IPM, is only calculated for models capable of generating images (Imagen 3), but is conceptually similar to TPM. Rate limits are tied to the projects usage tier (which we will soon be rolling out). As your API usage and spending increase, you'll have an option to upgrade to a higher tier with increased rate limits. When you request an upgrade, our automated abuse protection system performs additional checks. While meeting the stated qualification criteria is generally sufficient for approval, in rare cases an upgrade request may be denied based on other factors identified during the review process. This system helps ensure the security and integrity of the Gemini API platform for all users. [*] Specified rate limits are not guaranteed and actual capacity may vary. Each model variation has an associated rate limit (requests per minute, RPM). For details on those rate limits, see Gemini models. We offer no guarantees about increasing your rate limit, but we'll do our best to review your request and reach out to you if we're able to accommodate your capacity needs.
