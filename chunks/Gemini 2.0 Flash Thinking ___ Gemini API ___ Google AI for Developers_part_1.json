  "text": "# Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking ___ Gemini API ___ Google AI for Developers The Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model is an experimental model that's trained to generate the \"thinking process\" the model goes through as part of its response. As a result, the Flash Thinking model is capable of stronger reasoning capabilities in its responses than the Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental model. Flash Thinking models are available in Google AI Studio and through the Gemini API. The Gemini API doesn't return thoughts in the response. This example uses the new Google Genai SDK and the v1alpha version of the API. from google import genai client = genai.Client(api_key='GEMINI_API_KEY', http_options={'api_version':'v1alpha'}) response = client.models.generate_content( model='gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp', contents='Explain how RLHF works in simple terms.', ) print(response.text) from google import genai client = genai.Client(api_key='GEMINI_API_KEY', http_options={'api_version':'v1alpha'}) response = client.models.generate_content( model='gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp', contents='Explain how RLHF works in simple terms.', ) print(response.text) During multi-turn conversations, you pass the entire conversation history as input, so the model has access to its previous thoughts in a multi-turn conversation. The new Google Genai SDK provides the ability to create a multi-turn chat session which is helpful to manage the state of a conversation. from google import genai client = genai.Client(api_key='GEMINI_API_KEY', http_options={'api_version':'v1alpha'}) chat = client.aio.chats.create( model='gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp', ) response = await chat.send_message('What is your name?') print(response.text) response = await chat.send_message('What did you just say before this?') print(response.text) from google import genai client = genai.Client(api_key='GEMINI_API_KEY', http_options={'api_version':'v1alpha'}) chat = client.aio.chats.create( model='gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp', ) response = await chat.send_message('What is your name?') print(response.text) response = await chat.send_message('What did you just say before this?') print(response.text) The Flash Thinking model is an experimental model and has the following limitations: Except as otherwise noted, the content of this page is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, and code samples are licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
