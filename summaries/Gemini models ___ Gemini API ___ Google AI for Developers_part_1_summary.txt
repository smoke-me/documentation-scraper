# Gemini Models Overview

## Introduction
Gemini models are Google's latest multimodal AI models designed for enhanced performance and versatility across various input types, including audio, images, video, and text.

## Key Features
- **Multimodal Input**: Accepts audio, images, video, and text, providing text responses.
- **High Performance**: Low latency and optimized for cost efficiency.
- **Large Context Window**: Supports a 1 million token context window.
- **Model Variants**: Different models tailored for specific use cases.

## Model Variants
1. **Gemini 2.0 Flash**
   - Next-gen features with improved capabilities.
   - Optimized for speed and multimodal generation.
   - Supports audio (coming soon), images (coming soon), and text.

2. **Gemini 1.5 Flash**
   - Fast and versatile for diverse tasks.
   - **1.5 Flash-8B**: Smaller model for lower intelligence tasks.
   - **1.5 Pro**: Mid-size model optimized for reasoning tasks, capable of processing large datasets (e.g., 2 hours of video, 19 hours of audio).

3. **Text Embedding Model**
   - Generates text embeddings with 768 dimensions for input text up to 2,048 tokens.
   - Achieves superior retrieval performance on MTEB benchmarks.

4. **Attributed Question-Answering (AQA) Model**
   - Performs AQA tasks over documents or passages, providing grounded answers and answerable probabilities.

## Token Information
- 1 token ≈ 4 characters.
- 100 tokens ≈ 60-80 English words.

## Model Naming Conventions
- **Latest**: Points to the cutting-edge version (use for exploratory testing).
  - Format: `<model>-<generation>-<variation>-latest` (e.g., `gemini-1.0-pro-latest`).
  
- **Latest Stable**: Most recent stable version.
  - Format: `<model>-<generation>-<variation>` (e.g., `gemini-1.0-pro`).
  
- **Stable**: Specific stable model for production use.
  - Format: `<model>-<generation>-<variation>-<version>` (e.g., `gemini-1.0-pro-001`).
  
- **Experimental**: Models in preview, not for production use.
  - Format: `<model>-<generation>-<variation>-<version>` (e.g., `gemini-exp-1121`).
