# Gemini API - Experimental Models Documentation

## Overview
The Gemini API includes experimental models available in Preview, intended for feedback and rapid innovation. These models are not for production use and may be swapped without notice. There is no guarantee that experimental models will transition to stable versions.

## Accessing Experimental Models
- **Usage**: Experimental models can be accessed via the Gemini API or Google AI Studio.
- **Model Specification**: Use the model code in your requests. Example:
  ```python
  response = client.models.generate_content(model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp", contents="How does RLHF work?")
  ```
- **Selection in Google AI Studio**: Choose the model from the Model drop-down menu labeled "Preview".

## Capabilities of Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental
- **Text-to-Speech**: Generate high-quality audio outputs that resemble human voice.
- **Multimodal Generation**: Output text with inline images, enabling conversational editing and multimodal outputs.

### Image Generation Features (Private Experimental Release)
- **Text to Image**: Example prompt: "Generate an image of the Eiffel tower with fireworks."
- **Interleaved Text and Images**: Example prompt: "Generate an illustrated recipe for a paella."
- **Image Editing**: Example prompt: "Edit this image to make it look like a cartoon."
- **Multi-turn Image Editing**: Example prompts: "Turn this car into a convertible." followed by "Now change the color to yellow."
- **Watermarking**: All generated images include a SynthID watermark. 

### Restrictions
