# Gemini API Audio Capabilities Documentation

## Overview
The Gemini API enables interaction with audio content, allowing users to describe, summarize, and answer questions related to audio files. 

## Key Features
- **Audio Analysis**: Responds to prompts about audio, including transcription and segment-specific queries.
- **Supported Formats**: Accepts various audio format MIME types.
- **Token Representation**: Each second of audio is represented as 32 tokens (e.g., 1 minute = 1,920 tokens).
- **Language Support**: Primarily supports English-language speech but can recognize non-speech sounds (e.g., birdsong, sirens).
- **Audio Length Limit**: Maximum audio length per prompt is 9.5 hours. Multiple files can be included, but the total duration must not exceed this limit.
- **Audio Processing**: Audio is downsampled to 16 Kbps and multi-channel audio is combined into a single channel.

## Usage
1. **File Upload**: Use the File API to upload audio files.
2. **Text Output Generation**: Generate text outputs based on audio inputs.

## Additional Resources
- **File Prompting Strategies**: Supports multimodal prompting with text, image, audio, and video.
- **System Instructions**: Customize model behavior for specific use cases.
- **Safety Guidance**: Implement post-processing and human evaluation to mitigate risks of inaccurate or biased outputs.
