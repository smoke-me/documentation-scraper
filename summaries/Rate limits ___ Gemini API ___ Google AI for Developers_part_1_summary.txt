# Gemini API Rate Limits Documentation

## Overview
Rate limits for the Gemini API regulate the number of requests allowed within a specified timeframe to ensure fair usage, prevent abuse, and maintain system performance.

## Key Concepts
- **Rate Limits**: Applied per project, not per API key. Exceeding any limit triggers a rate limit error.
- **Requests per Minute (RPM)**: For example, if the RPM limit is 20, making 21 requests in a minute results in an error.
- **Total Requests per Minute (TPM)**: Some limits, like Images per Minute (IPM), apply only to specific models (e.g., Imagen 3).

## Usage Tiers
- Rate limits are linked to the project's usage tier, which can be upgraded for increased limits as API usage and spending grow.
- Upgrade requests are subject to an automated review process, and while meeting criteria is typically sufficient, upgrades may be denied based on additional factors.

## Important Notes
- Specified rate limits are not guaranteed; actual capacity may vary.
- Each model variation has its own associated rate limits.
- Review the Gemini models documentation for specific rate limit details.
