# Gemini API Tokenization Overview

## Key Concepts
- **Tokens**: The basic units of input and output processed by Gemini models. Tokens can be individual characters or whole words. Long words may be divided into multiple tokens.
- **Vocabulary**: The complete set of tokens utilized by the model.
- **Tokenization**: The process of converting text into tokens.

## Token Characteristics
- A single token is approximately equivalent to 4 characters.
- 100 tokens roughly correspond to 60-80 English words.

## Billing Information
- When billing is enabled, the cost of using the Gemini API is influenced by the number of input and output tokens.
