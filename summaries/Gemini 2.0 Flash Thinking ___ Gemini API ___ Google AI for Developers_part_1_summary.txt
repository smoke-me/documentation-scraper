# Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Documentation

## Overview
The Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model is an experimental AI model designed to enhance reasoning capabilities by generating the "thinking process" behind its responses. It is available through Google AI Studio and the Gemini API.

## Key Features
- **Enhanced Reasoning**: The Flash Thinking model provides stronger reasoning in responses compared to the standard Gemini 2.0 model.
- **Multi-Turn Conversations**: Supports multi-turn interactions by maintaining conversation history, allowing the model to reference previous messages.

## Usage

### API Access
To use the Gemini API, you must initialize the client with your API key and specify the API version.

```python
from google import genai

client = genai.Client(api_key='GEMINI_API_KEY', http_options={'api_version':'v1alpha'})
```

### Generating Content
To generate content using the Flash Thinking model, use the following code:

```python
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp',
    contents='Explain how RLHF works in simple terms.'
)
print(response.text)
```

### Multi-Turn Chat Sessions
To create a multi-turn chat session, use the following code:

```python
chat = client.aio.chats.create(model='gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp')

response = await chat.send_message('What is your name?')
print(response.text)

response = await chat.send_message('What did you just say before this?')
print(response.text)
```

## Limitations
The Flash Thinking model is experimental and may have limitations in performance and reliability.
