# Gemini API: Introduction to Prompt Design

## Overview
Prompt design involves crafting natural language requests to elicit specific responses from language models. Effective prompts are crucial for obtaining accurate and high-quality outputs.

## Key Concepts
- **Prompt**: A natural language request submitted to a language model, which can include questions, instructions, contextual information, examples, and partial inputs.
- **Response Types**: The model can generate various outputs, including text, embeddings, code, images, videos, and music.

## Types of Inputs
1. **Question Input**: A direct question for the model to answer.
   - *Example*: "What's a good name for a flower shop that specializes in selling bouquets of dried flowers?"
   
2. **Task Input**: A request for the model to perform a specific task.
   - *Example*: "Give me a simple list of just the things that I must bring on a camping trip."

3. **Entity Input**: Input that the model classifies or summarizes.
   - *Example*: "Classify the following items as [large, small]: Elephant, Mouse, Snail."

4. **Completion Input**: Text that the model is expected to complete or continue.
   - *Example*: "Some simple strategies for overcoming writer's block include..."

## Additional Elements
- **Instructions**: Specify how the model should behave or the context for generating responses.
- **Contextual Information**: Provide necessary background or restrictions within the prompt.
- **Examples**: Input-output pairs that guide the model toward the desired response format.

## Best Practices
- Use clear and concise language in prompts.
- Include relevant contextual information to guide the model.
- Provide examples to illustrate the expected output format.

## Next Steps
- Experiment with writing prompts using Google AI Studio.
- Explore advanced topics such as prompt strategies and multimodal prompting.
