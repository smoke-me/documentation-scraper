# Gemini API Documentation

## Overview
The Gemini API provides access to advanced generative models capable of processing extensive context windows, enabling new use cases and developer paradigms. Gemini 1.5 Flash and Gemini 2.0 Flash support a 1-million-token context window, while Gemini 1.5 Pro supports a 2-million-token context window.

## Key Concepts
- **Context Window**: Analogous to short-term memory, it defines the amount of information (tokens) that can be processed at once.
- **Token Capacity**: 
  - Gemini 1.5: 1 million tokens
  - Gemini 1.5 Pro: 2 million tokens

## Getting Started
- **Long Context Usage**: Unlike previous models limited to 8,000 to 128,000 tokens, Gemini models can handle significantly larger contexts, allowing for richer interactions and in-context learning.
- **Common Use Cases**:
  - Text summarization
  - Question answering
  - Agentic workflows
  - Many-shot in-context learning

## Multimodal Capabilities
Gemini models can process text, video, audio, and images, facilitating various use cases:
- **Text**: Enhanced summarization and question-answering capabilities.
- **Video**: Improved video question answering, captioning, and recommendations.
- **Audio**: Real-time transcription, translation, and voice assistant functionalities.

## Optimization Techniques
- **Context Caching**: Reduces costs by storing user-uploaded files on a per-hour basis, making it economically feasible to handle high token workloads.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Using context caching can lower input/output costs significantly (up to 4x less).

## Limitations
- Performance may vary with multiple queries or "needles" in context.
- Higher input token costs for repeated queries can impact overall efficiency.

## FAQs
- **Does adding more tokens reduce performance?**: Not necessarily; the model can extract information from large contexts effectively.
- **How does Gemini 1.5 Pro perform on needle-in-a-haystack tests?**: Achieves 100% recall up to 530k tokens and >99.7% recall up to 1M tokens.
- **How to access the 2-million-token context window?**: Available to all developers using Gemini 1.5 Pro.

## Conclusion
The Gemini API represents a significant advancement in generative models, offering extensive context processing capabilities and multimodal support, unlocking new possibilities for developers.
