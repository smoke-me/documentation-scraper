# Fine-Tuning with the Gemini API

## Overview
Fine-tuning enhances model performance on specific tasks and aligns outputs with desired requirements, especially when few-shot prompting is insufficient. This guide provides an overview of fine-tuning the Gemini API text model.

## Key Concepts
- **Fine-Tuning**: A supervised process that improves model performance by training on a dataset of examples.
- **Training Dataset**: Must include high-quality, diverse examples with structured inputs and expected outputs.
- **Inference**: The tuned model utilizes newly learned parameters to perform tasks during inference.

## Dataset Requirements
- **Quality**: Ensure examples are representative of expected production inputs and outputs.
- **Format Consistency**: Production data must match the dataset format (e.g., specific keywords or structure).
- **Example Count**: Minimum of 20 examples; 100-500 examples recommended for optimal performance.

### Example Training Data
```python
training_data = [
    {"text_input": "1", "output": "2"},
    {"text_input": "3", "output": "4"},
    ...
]
```

## Fine-Tuning Process
1. **Prepare Dataset**: Structure examples with prompts and expected outputs.
2. **Run Tuning Job**: The model learns additional parameters to improve task performance.
3. **Output**: A new model combining original and learned parameters.

## Fine-Tuning Specifications
- **Input Size**: Max 40,000 characters per example.
- **Output Size**: Max 5,000 characters per example.
- **Data Submission**: Can be passed inline via API or uploaded in Google AI Studio (max file size: 4 MB).

## Advanced Settings for Tuning Job
- **Epochs**: Full training passes over the dataset.
- **Batch Size**: Number of examples processed in one iteration.
- **Learning Rate**: Controls the adjustment strength of model parameters.
- **Learning Rate Multiplier**: Modifies the original learning rate.

## Monitoring and Error Handling
- Check tuning job status in Google AI Studio or via the Gemini API.
- Authentication is required (API key recommended or OAuth credentials).
- Errors such as 'PermissionDenied: 403' may indicate insufficient authentication scopes.

## Cancellation of Tuning Jobs
- Tuning jobs can be canceled before completion, but performance may be unpredictable if canceled early.
- For early stopping, create a new job with a lower epoch value.
