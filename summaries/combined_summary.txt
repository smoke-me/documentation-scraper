# Combined Documentation Summary

## About Generative Models Gemini Api Google Ai For Developers Part 1

# Gemini API Documentation

## Overview
The Gemini API provides access to generative AI models capable of creating content from various data inputs, including text, images, and audio. These models function similarly to advanced autocomplete systems, predicting likely outputs based on input prompts.

## Key Features
- **Content Generation**: Create poetry, stories, and summaries from text prompts.
- **No ML Expertise Required**: Users can generate content without needing to train models or collect datasets.
- **Generative Models**: Unlike traditional large language models (LLMs), Gemini models handle multiple data types.

## Prompt Design
- **Basic Prompts**: Simple instructions like "Write me a poem" can yield effective results.
- **Few-Shot Prompting**: Utilize patterns to guide the model. For example, using a format like `[country] : [capital]` allows the model to autocomplete based on learned patterns.
- **Zero-Shot Prompts**: These prompts do not provide examples, relying on the model's pre-existing knowledge.

## Prompt Types
1. **Zero-Shot**: No examples provided; relies on model knowledge.
2. **Few-Shot**: Includes examples for the model to replicate.
3. **Instructional**: Provides clear instructions to guide the model's response.

## Model Parameters
- **Max Output Tokens**: Limits the number of tokens generated (approx. 4 characters per token).
- **Temperature**: Controls randomness in responses. A temperature of 0 is deterministic, while higher values allow for more creative outputs.
- **topK**: Determines how many of the most probable tokens are considered for selection.
- **topP**: Selects tokens based on cumulative probability until reaching a specified threshold.
- **Stop Sequences**: Defines a sequence that, when generated, stops further output.

## Generating Responses
- Responses can be generated through deterministic methods (selecting the most probable token) or stochastic methods (random sampling).
- The degree of randomness is controlled by the temperature setting.

## Experimentation
Users are encouraged to experiment with different prompt structures and parameters to optimize model responses.

## Generate Structured Output With The Gemini Api Google Ai For Developers Part 1

# Gemini API: Generating Structured Output

## Overview
The Gemini API allows users to generate structured JSON output, which is useful for applications requiring automated processing of data. By default, Gemini produces unstructured text, but it can be constrained to respond in JSON format.

## Use Cases
- Building a database of companies from newspaper articles.
- Extracting ingredients from recipes with links to grocery websites.

## Generating JSON Responses
1. **Requesting JSON Output**: In your prompt, specify that you want JSON-formatted output. Note that while Gemini aims to respond in JSON, it may not always guarantee this format.
2. **Using Response Schema**: For more deterministic responses, include a `responseSchema` field with a specific JSON schema to ensure the output adheres to the expected structure.

## JSON Schema Configuration
- **Schema Object**: Define the shape of the JSON data using a Schema object, which is a subset of the OpenAPI 3.0 Schema object.
- **Key Fields**:
  - `type`: Must be one of the OpenAPI Data Types.
  - `properties`: Defines the structure of objects.
  - `required`: Lists required properties.
  - `propertyOrdering`: Specifies the order of properties in the response.

### Example Schema Representations
```json
{ "type": "STRING", "enum": ["a", "b", "c"] }
{ "type": "INTEGER", "format": "int64" }
{ "type": "OBJECT", "properties": { "a": { "type": "STRING" }, "b": { "type": "INTEGER" } }, "required": ["a"] }
```

## Important Considerations
- **Property Ordering**: The API orders properties alphabetically by default. To maintain a specific order, use the `propertyOrdering[]` field.
- **Consistency in Examples**: Ensure that examples provided to the model match the property ordering defined in the schema to improve output quality.
