# Gemini API: File Prompting Strategies

## Overview
The Gemini API supports multimodal input, allowing users to interact with text, images, and audio. This flexibility enables a variety of tasks, such as generating blog posts based on images.

## Best Practices for Multimodal Prompts
1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear and concise instructions to minimize misinterpretation.
2. **Use Examples**: Incorporate few-shot examples to illustrate desired outputs.
3. **Break Down Tasks**: Divide complex tasks into manageable steps.
4. **Specify Output Format**: Indicate the required output format (e.g., markdown, JSON).
5. **Image Placement**: For single-image prompts, place the image before the text for better performance.

## Troubleshooting Strategies
- **Direct Image References**: If the model fails to draw relevant information, specify which aspects of the image to focus on.
- **Descriptive Prompts**: Ask the model to describe the image before proceeding with the task to ensure it understands the context.
- **Step-by-Step Reasoning**: For complex tasks, instruct the model to think step-by-step.

## Sampling Parameters
When sending requests, adjust the following parameters for optimal results:
- **Temperature**: Controls randomness in responses. Start at 0.4 for balanced outputs; adjust higher for creativity or lower for determinism.
- **Top-K**: Determines how many of the most probable tokens are considered. Default is 32; lower values yield less randomness.
- **Top-P**: Selects tokens until their cumulative probability meets the specified threshold. Default is 1.0; lower values reduce randomness.

## Next Steps
- Experiment with multimodal prompts using Google AI Studio.
