# Combined Documentation Summary

## About Generative Models Gemini Api Google Ai For Developers Part 1

# Gemini API Documentation

## Overview
The Gemini API provides access to generative AI models capable of creating content from various data inputs, including text, images, and audio. These models function similarly to advanced autocomplete systems, predicting likely outputs based on input patterns.

## Key Features
- **Content Generation**: Create poetry, stories, and summaries from text prompts.
- **No ML Expertise Required**: Users can prototype applications by simply describing desired outcomes.
- **Generative Models**: Unlike traditional large language models (LLMs), Gemini models can process multiple data types.

## Prompt Design
- **Basic Prompts**: Direct instructions (e.g., "Write me a poem about puppies").
- **Few-shot Prompts**: Provide examples to establish patterns for the model to replicate (e.g., country-capital pairs).
- **Zero-shot Prompts**: Allow the model to generate responses without examples, relying on its existing knowledge.

## Prompt Types
1. **Zero-shot**: No examples provided; relies on model knowledge.
2. **Few-shot**: Includes examples to guide the model's output.
3. **Instruction-based**: Clearly states the task for the model.

## Model Parameters
- **Max Output Tokens**: Limits the number of tokens generated (approx. 4 characters per token).
- **Temperature**: Controls randomness in responses (0 = deterministic, higher values = more creativity).
- **topK**: Determines how many of the most probable tokens are considered for selection.
- **topP**: Selects tokens based on cumulative probability.
- **stop_sequences**: Defines sequences that signal the model to stop generating content.

## Response Generation
Responses are generated in two stages:
1. **Probability Distribution**: The model predicts the likelihood of possible next tokens based on the input.
2. **Decoding Strategy**: Converts probabilities into text using deterministic or stochastic methods.

## Experimentation
Users are encouraged to experiment with different prompt structures and parameters to optimize model responses.

## Best Practices
Refer to the Prompt guidelines for effective prompt creation strategies.

## Context Caching Gemini Api Google Ai For Developers Part 1

# Context Caching - Gemini API

## Overview
The context caching feature of the Gemini API allows users to cache input tokens, reducing costs and improving efficiency in AI workflows. Once tokens are cached, they can be reused in subsequent requests without needing to resend the same input.

## Key Features
- **Caching Duration (TTL)**: Users can set a Time to Live (TTL) for cached tokens, defaulting to 1 hour if not specified. There are no minimum or maximum bounds on TTL.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Caching is more cost-effective for high volumes of repeated input. Charges are based on:
  - **Cache Token Count**: Number of input tokens cached, billed at a reduced rate for subsequent prompts.
  - **Storage Duration**: Cost based on how long tokens are stored (TTL).
  - **Other Charges**: Applies to non-cached input and output tokens.

## Supported Models
- Gemini 1.5 Pro

## Dataset Requirements
- Structure: Each example must include prompt inputs and expected outputs.
- Consistency: Production data must match the format and context of the training examples.
- Size: Minimum of 20 examples; 100-500 examples recommended for optimal performance.

### Example Training Data
```python
training_data = [
    {"text_input": "1", "output": "2"},
    {"text_input": "3", "output": "4"},
    ...
]
```

## Fine-tuning Process
1. **Prepare Dataset**: Ensure examples are formatted correctly and representative of expected usage.
2. **Run Tuning Job**: The model learns additional parameters to perform the desired task.
3. **Output**: A new model combining original and learned parameters.

## Fine-tuning Limitations
- Maximum input size: 40,000 characters.
- Maximum output size: 5,000 characters.
- Data can be passed inline or through files (max file size: 4 MB).

## Advanced Settings
- **Epochs**: Number of training passes over the dataset.
- **Batch Size**: Number of examples processed in one iteration.
- **Learning Rate**: Controls the adjustment strength of model parameters.
- **Learning Rate Multiplier**: Modifies the original learning rate.

### Recommendations
- Adjust epochs based on the loss curve; stop training before it plateaus.
- Monitor tuning job status in Google AI Studio.

## Authentication
- Required for API and client library access.
- Recommended to use an API key; OAuth credentials can also be configured.

To enable Grounding with Google Search, configure the API as follows:

```python
from google import genai
from google.genai.types import Tool, GenerateContentConfig, GoogleSearch

client = genai.Client()
model_id = "gemini-2.0-flash"
google_search_tool = Tool(google_search=GoogleSearch())

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=model_id,
    contents="When is the next total solar eclipse in the United States?",
    config=GenerateContentConfig(
        tools=[google_search_tool],
        response_modalities=["TEXT"],
    )
)

for each in response.candidates[0].content.parts:
    print(each.text)

# Access grounding metadata
print(response.candidates[0].grounding_metadata.search_entry_point.rendered_content)
```

## Functionality
- **Multi-turn Searches**: Supports complex prompts and workflows requiring planning and reasoning.
- **Language Support**: Works with all available languages for text prompts.

## Safety Settings Gemini Api Google Ai For Developers Part 1

# Gemini API Safety Settings Documentation

## Overview
The Gemini API provides adjustable safety settings to manage content filtering during application prototyping. These settings allow developers to configure content restrictions based on four filter categories, ensuring appropriate content for specific use cases.

## Key Concepts
- **Safety Filters**: Adjustable filters that categorize content as SAFE, DANGEROUS, etc. Developers can allow or restrict content based on these categories.
- **Built-in Protections**: Certain core harms (e.g., child safety) are always blocked and cannot be adjusted.
- **Probability Levels**: Content is classified as HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, or NEGLIGIBLE in terms of being unsafe. Blocking is based on probability, not severity.

## Default Settings
- By default, the API blocks content with a medium or higher probability of being unsafe across all categories.
- Default thresholds vary by model:
  - **Civic Integrity**: Block none for certain models, Block most for others.
  - **Other Categories**: Block none or Block some, depending on the model.

## Adjusting Safety Settings
Safety settings can be adjusted per request using the `GenerateContent` API call. The response includes safety feedback, detailing any blocked content.

### Example Code Snippet
```python
from google import genai
from google.genai import types
import PIL.Image

img = PIL.Image.open("cookies.jpg")
client = genai.Client(api_key="GEMINI_API_KEY")
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    contents=['Do these look store-bought or homemade?', img],
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        safety_settings=[
            types.SafetySetting(
